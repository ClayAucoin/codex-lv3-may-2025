# Level 13: Navigation Between Stories âš¡ CHALLENGE LEVEL

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily move between different Mad Libs stories so that I can browse through my collection without getting lost.

## What You'll Do
Add navigation links to move between stories and improve user experience.

## Instructions
- Add "Next Story" link when available
- Add navigation links to random story and main form
- Handle boundary conditions (no next story at end)

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help with navigation? Check out these snippets:
- **Conditional links:** Use `if (hasNextStory)` to show/hide links
- **Link generation:** Use template literals for dynamic URLs
- **Boundary checking:** Check `storyNumber < stories.length`

## âœ… Check
1. Navigate to individual stories
2. You should see appropriate navigation links
3. "Next Story" should only appear when there is a next story
4. All navigation should work correctly
5. If navigation doesn't work, check your conditional logic
