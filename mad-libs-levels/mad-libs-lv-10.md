# Level 10: Data Storage in Memory âš¡ CHALLENGE LEVEL

> **Note:** Levels 10 and beyond are challenge levels that extend the basic Mad Libs functionality. These are optional but recommended for a more complete learning experience.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my completed Mad Libs stories so that I can read them again later and share them with friends.

## What You'll Do
Store completed stories in an in-memory array for later access.

## Instructions
- Create a global array to store stories
- Push completed stories to the array
- Add a link to view all stories

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help with arrays? Check out these snippets:
- **Global array:** Use `let stories = [];` outside route handlers
- **Array push:** Use `stories.push(storyContent);`
- **Array length:** Use `stories.length` to check array size
- **Console testing:** Use `console.log(stories);` to see stored stories

## âœ… Check
1. Create and submit multiple stories
2. Check your server console to see `console.log(stories)` output
3. Verify the array grows with each submission
4. If stories aren't stored, check your array operations and console output
