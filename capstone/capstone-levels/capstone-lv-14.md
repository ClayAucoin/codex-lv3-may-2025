# Level 14: Basic API Call

## What You'll Do
Make your first API call and display the response.

## Instructions
- Use `fetch()` to make an API call
- Handle the response with `.then()` and `.catch()`
- **Two changes needed on generated code:** Change `response.text()` to `response.json()`, and change arrow function to regular function (see Postman Generated Code section in Code Hints)
- Display the response in your output area

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help with API calls? Check out these snippets:
- **Postman Generated Code:** See [SNIPPETS.md](../SNIPPETS.md#postman-generated-code) for `fetch()` examples
- **Response handling:** Use `.then()` to process the response

## âœ… Check
1. Open your webpage in a browser
2. Click the button to trigger your API call
3. You should see the API response in the output area
4. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab for any errors
5. If you see errors, check your API URL and response handling
