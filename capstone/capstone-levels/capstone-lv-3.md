# Level 3: Git Setup

## What You'll Do
Initialize version control and push your project to GitHub.

## Instructions
- Initialize a git repository (`git init`)
- Add all files to git (`git add .`)
- Create your first commit with a meaningful message like `chore: initial project setup`
- Push to GitHub (if you have a remote repository set up)

## ‚úÖ Check
1. Open your terminal/command prompt in your project folder
2. Run `git status` - you should see "On branch main" and "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
3. Run `git log --oneline` - you should see your commit message like "chore: initial project setup"
4. **IMPORTANT:** Check that `secret-variables.js` is NOT on GitHub:
   - Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser
   - Look through the files - you should NOT see `secret-variables.js` listed
   - If you see it, check your `.gitignore` file includes `secret-variables.js`
5. If you see any errors, make sure you're in the correct folder and try the git commands again

## üîç Exploration: Commit Message Prefixes

You might be wondering why we use prefixes like `chore:` or `feature:` at the start of commit messages. These are part of a best practice convention called **Conventional Commits** that helps organize and categorize your changes:

- **`chore:`** - For maintenance tasks, setup, or non-functional changes (like adding files, updating dependencies, or initial project setup)
- **`feature:`** - For new functionality or features you're adding to your project
- **`fix:`** - For bug fixes or corrections
- **`docs:`** - For documentation changes
- **`style:`** - For formatting, styling, or code style changes
- **`refactor:`** - For code restructuring without changing functionality

Using these prefixes makes it easier to:
- Quickly understand what type of change each commit represents
- Generate changelogs automatically
- Filter commits by type when reviewing project history
- Follow consistent practices in professional development

In this level, we use `chore:` because we're doing initial project setup - creating the foundation without adding new features yet.
