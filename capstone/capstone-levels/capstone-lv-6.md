## Instructions
Add Bootstrap classes to style the input and button.

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints

**Stuck on styling?** Bootstrap has special classes for form elements. Check out the [Bootstrap Classes section in SNIPPETS.md](../SNIPPETS.md#bootstrap-classes) for inspiration.

## ðŸ“š Connect to Previous Lessons

**Working with Bootstrap classes?** Check out [Week 4, Lesson 2: Bootstrap Framework](../../week4-css-frameworks/lesson-2-bootstrap-framework/) for a complete guide to Bootstrap utilities and components. Focus on the button and form styling sections.

## âœ… Check
1. Open your webpage in a browser
2. You should see your input and button with Bootstrap styling (they should look more polished)
3. The input should have a clean border and the button should have Bootstrap button styling
4. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab for any errors
5. If the styling doesn't look right, check that Bootstrap CSS is properly linked in your HTML
