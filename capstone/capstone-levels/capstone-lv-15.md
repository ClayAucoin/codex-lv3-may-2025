# Level 15: API Response Processing

## What You'll Do
Process the API response to extract and display meaningful data.

## Instructions
- Parse the JSON response
- Extract the specific data you need (for example, temperature? pokemon stats?)
- Format and display it nicely in your output area

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help with response processing? Check out these snippets:
- **JSON parsing:** See [SNIPPETS.md](../SNIPPETS.md#api-calls) for response handling examples
- **Data extraction:** Use dot notation to access nested properties
- **Formatting:** Use `console.log()` to test how you want to format the data before displaying it to users in a later level.

## âœ… Check
1. Open your webpage in a browser
2. Click the button to trigger your API call
3. You should see formatted data in the output area (not raw JSON)
4. The data should be meaningful and well-formatted
5. If you see raw JSON or errors, check your response processing code
