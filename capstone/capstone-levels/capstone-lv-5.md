# Level 5: UI & DOM Wiring - Basic Interface

**Goal:** Build the Bootstrap UI, connect it with helpers (or direct DOM methods), and test interactions.
*(Choose meaningful `id`s. Example only: `<input id="userPrompt">`.)*

---

## What You'll Do
Add the basic interface elements to your HTML.

## Instructions
In the HTML, add the interface:
- An input for the user's prompt
- A button to send
- A plain `<div>` or a `<pre>` for the output (no styling yet)

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help with the HTML structure? Check out these snippets:
- **HTML IDs and JavaScript access:** See [SNIPPETS.md](../SNIPPETS.md#html-ids-and-javascript-access) for ID naming and element access
- **Input elements:** See [SNIPPETS.md](../SNIPPETS.md#bootstrap-classes) for `<input>` examples
- **Button elements:** See [SNIPPETS.md](../SNIPPETS.md#bootstrap-classes) for `<button>` examples
- **Basic structure:** Use meaningful `id` attributes like `id="user-chat-input"` and `id="send-btn"`

## âœ… Check
Navigate to your file in your browser (remember, you're using live-server) and verify you can see:
- A text input box where you can type
- A button (it won't do anything yet, but it should be visible)
- A blank area below for the output
- Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab for any errors
