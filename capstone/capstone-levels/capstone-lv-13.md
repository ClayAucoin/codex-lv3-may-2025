# Level 13: API Integration Planning

## What You'll Do
Choose and plan your API integration based on your project requirements.

## Instructions
- Review the [OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md) requirements for API integration
- Choose one or more APIs from the suggested list
- Plan how you'll integrate them into your project
- Set up your API keys in `secret-variables.js`

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help choosing APIs? Check out these resources:
- **API Selection:** See [SNIPPETS.md](../SNIPPETS.md#api-calls) for API examples
- **API Keys:** Make sure to add your keys to `secret-variables.js` and reference them as global variables

## ðŸ“š Connect to Previous Lessons
**Working with APIs?** Check out [Week 6: APIs and Postman](../../week6-APIs-and-postman/) for a complete guide to API integration, testing with Postman, and handling responses.

## âœ… Check
1. Review the [OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md) requirements
2. Choose your APIs and plan your integration
3. Add your API keys to `secret-variables.js`
4. Test that your keys are accessible as global variables
5. If you need help choosing APIs, ask your instructor or check the suggested list in the outline
