# Level 17: User Interaction Design

## What You'll Do
Design and implement user interactions that make your API calls more dynamic and useful. This is your chance to get creative and bring your unique idea to life! Think about what would make your app engaging and fun to use. Consider how users will discover and interact with your creation - will they click buttons, type inputs, or explore different options? This is where your project transforms from a simple API call into something truly special that showcases your creativity and problem-solving skills.

## Instructions
- Think about how you want your user to interact with your app and the API you chose
- Consider different interaction patterns:
  - **Single button:** One button that triggers the API call
  - **Multiple buttons:** Different buttons for different actions (e.g., one for each city, like in week 6 weather-app)
  - **Input fields:** Allow users to enter data that gets inserted to the URL (e.g., latitude and longitude)
  - **Conditional logic:** Use if statements to handle different user inputs (e.g., `if(input === "joke") { fetchJokeAPI() }`)
- Choose the interaction pattern that best fits your API and user needs
- Implement your chosen interaction pattern
- Remember to test as you go, as we did in the previous levels.

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help with user interactions? Check out these snippets:
- **Multiple buttons:** See [SNIPPETS.md](../SNIPPETS.md#event-handling) for multiple button examples
- **Input handling:** Use `getValue()` to get user input and add it to your API URL
- **Conditional logic:** Use `if` statements to handle different user choices

## âœ… Check
1. Open your webpage in a browser
2. Test your chosen interaction pattern:
   - If using buttons, click each one to verify it works
   - If using inputs, type different values and test the results
   - If using conditional logic, test different input scenarios
3. Verify that your API calls work with the user interactions
4. Make sure the user experience feels intuitive and responsive
