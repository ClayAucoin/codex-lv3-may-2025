# Level 4: Overall Project Check

## What You'll Do
Verify everything is working correctly with both live-server and git.

## Instructions
Run comprehensive tests to ensure your project setup is complete and secure.

## âœ… Check
1. **Live Server Test:**
   - Run `npx live-server` in your project folder
   - Open your browser and navigate to the live-server URL
   - You should see your project title as a large heading (H1)
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab
   - Look for any red error messages - if there are none, you're good to go!

2. **Git Status Check:**
   - Run `git status` - you should see "On branch main" and "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
   - Run `git log --oneline` - you should see your commit message

3. **Security Check:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser
   - Look through the files - you should NOT see `secret-variables.js` listed
   - If you see it, check your `.gitignore` file includes `secret-variables.js`
   - If you do accidentally commit your `secret-variables.js`, GitHub will not allow you to upload it. Ask for help on how to remove it from your git history.

## Check off these items in your README:
- [ ] All required files created: `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`, `helpers-full.js`, `secret-variables.js`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`
- [ ] Bootstrap CSS linked and scripts included in correct order
- [ ] Git repository initialized with first commit and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Live server runs and page loads without errors
- [ ] `secret-variables.js` is NOT visible on GitHub (security check passed)

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!
You've set up your project foundation securely. Time to build the UI!
