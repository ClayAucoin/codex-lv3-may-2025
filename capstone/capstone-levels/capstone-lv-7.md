# Level 7: Card Structure

## What You'll Do
Convert the output area into a proper Bootstrap card.

## Instructions
Convert the output `<div>` into a Bootstrap card with proper structure (card container, body, title, and text).

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints

**Building Bootstrap cards?** Cards need specific container and content classes to look right. Check out the [Bootstrap Classes section in SNIPPETS.md](../SNIPPETS.md#bootstrap-classes) for card structure examples.

## âœ… Check
1. Open your webpage in a browser
2. You should see a Bootstrap card where your output area used to be
3. The card should have a clean border, padding, and professional appearance
4. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab for any errors
5. If the card doesn't appear styled, check that you're using the correct Bootstrap card classes
