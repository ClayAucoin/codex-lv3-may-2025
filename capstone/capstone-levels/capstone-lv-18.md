# Level 18: AI Integration Planning

## What You'll Do
Choose and plan your AI model integration based on your project requirements.

## Instructions
- Review the [OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md) requirements for AI integration
- Choose one or more AI models from the suggested list
- Plan how you'll integrate them into your project
- Set up your AI API keys in `secret-variables.js`

## ðŸ’¡ Code Hints
Need help choosing AI models? Check out these resources:
- **AI Model Selection:** Go to [huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models) and filter by "text generation" and "fireworks" (as shown in [Week 7 Lesson 1](../../week7-ai-models-and-APIs/lesson-1.md))
- **API Keys:** Make sure to add your keys to `secret-variables.js` and reference them as global variables

## ðŸ“š Connect to Previous Lessons
**Working with AI models?** Check out [Week 7: AI Models and APIs](../../week7-ai-models-and-APIs/) for a complete guide to AI integration, Hugging Face models, and prompt engineering.

## âœ… Check
1. Review the [OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md) requirements
2. Choose your AI models and plan your integration
3. Add your AI API keys to `secret-variables.js`
4. Test that your keys are accessible as global variables
5. If you need help choosing AI models, ask your instructor or check the suggested list in the outline
