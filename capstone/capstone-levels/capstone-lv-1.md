# Level 1: Project Planning & Setup

**Goal:** Plan your capstone project and set up the development environment.

---

## ðŸ“‹ **IMPORTANT: Complete Planning First!**

**Before you start coding, you must work through the planning document:**

ðŸ‘‰ **[Week 8 Capstone Planning Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A7uL2OYkXWNoNMemVPHGwj2a21PDppXSSrMBhjw_xyw/edit?usp=sharing)**

**Complete all sections of the planning document before proceeding with Level 1.** This will help you understand the project requirements, technical specifications, and success criteria.

## What You'll Do
Create a new project folder and set up all the necessary files to get started.

## Instructions
- Make a new folder for your project named `capstone-project`
- Inside, create these files:
  - `index.html`
  - `app.js`
  - `styles.css`
  - `helpers-full.js` (download from [class repository](../../week5-event-driven-apps/other-dev-files/helpers-full.js))
  - `README.md` (copy from [EXAMPLE_README.md](../EXAMPLE_README.md) template)


## â„¹ Third-Party File Info

Download `helpers-full.js` from the class repo:
[https://github.com/rmccrear/codex-lv2-may-2025/tree/main/guides/week5-event-driven-apps/other-dev-files](https://github.com/rmccrear/codex-lv2-may-2025/tree/main/guides/week5-event-driven-apps/other-dev-files)

Place it in your project folder before linking it in `index.html`.

## âœ… Check
Open your project folder in VS Code and verify you can see all 4 files:
- `index.html`
- `app.js` (we will use this instead of `script.js`)
- `styles.css`
- `helpers-full.js` (we will use this instead of `helpers.js` since it has a few more functions to use.)
- `README.md`

If any files are missing, create them before moving to Level 2.

> **Note:** What about `.gitignore` and `secret-variables.js`? These will be covered in a later level. (Before we add secrets.)
