# =============================================================================
# HOW THE PERL ONE-LINER WORKS
# =============================================================================
#
# The perl command processes the file line by line and renumbers level headers.
# Here's what each part does:
#
# perl -e '...'                    # Run perl with the code in quotes
# my $counter = 1;                 # Create a variable called $counter, start at 1
# while (<>) {                     # Loop through each line of input
#     if (/^# .*Level \d+: (.+)$/) # Check if line matches the pattern:
#                                   #   ^# = starts with "# "
#                                   #   .* = any characters (like emoji)
#                                   #   Level = literal word "Level"
#                                   #   \d+ = one or more digits
#                                   #   : = literal colon
#                                   #   (.+) = capture everything after colon
#         print "# ðŸŽ¯ Level $counter: $1\n";  # Print new level header with:
#                                            #   - Fixed emoji ðŸŽ¯
#                                            #   - Sequential number ($counter)
#                                            #   - Original title ($1)
#         $counter++;              # Increment counter for next level
#     } else {
#         print;                   # Print the line unchanged if not a level header
#     }
# }
#
# The result: All level headers get renumbered 1, 2, 3, 4... in order
# while all other lines (content, code, etc.) remain exactly the same.
