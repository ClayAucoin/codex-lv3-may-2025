# Level 8: Random Apple Position

**User Story:** As a player, I want the apple to appear in different locations so that I have to search for it and the game is more engaging.

## What You'll Do

Add state variables for apple position and randomize the position on each interaction.

## Instructions

- Create state variables `appleX` and `appleY` with initial value of 0
- Create a `randomSpot()` function that:
  - Sets `appleX` to a random value between 0 and 400
  - Sets `appleY` to a random value between 0 and 600
- Call `randomSpot()` in both `clickTarget` and `missTarget` functions
- Add `left` and `top` properties to the `appleStyle` object
- Test that the apple moves to different positions

**ðŸ’ª Practice Challenge:** This level is similar to Level 7. Try to complete it on your own using the same patterns!

## âœ… Check

1. Click the apple - it should move to a new random location
2. Click the background - apple should also move
3. The apple should stay within the game board boundaries
4. Both size and position should change simultaneously
5. If apple goes off-screen:
   - Check your random ranges (400 for X, 600 for Y)
   - Remember the game board is 500x700

**CSS Positioning Review:**
- `position: absolute` allows us to place elements anywhere
- `left` sets distance from the left edge
- `top` sets distance from the top edge
- Coordinates (0, 0) are at the top-left corner
