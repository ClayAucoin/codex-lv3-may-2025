|  | Activity Guide - Mad Libs Mini-Project | üìù |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

**Overview**  
Build a full-stack web application that generates funny Mad Libs stories! Create a form-based app using Node.js, Express, and Bootstrap where users fill in words to create hilarious stories.

**Model:** [Code.org Mad Libs Activity](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp5-virtual/units/1/lessons/7/levels/1)

---

## Step 1 - Play the Model Game

Try the Code.org Mad Libs activity linked above. Play for 5-10 minutes and create at least 2-3 stories.

**Discuss with a Partner:**
- How does a Mad Libs game work?
- What types of words are you asked to provide?
- What makes the resulting stories funny?
- How does the form collect and display information?

---

## Step 2 - Plan Your Mad Libs Story

**Story Template:** Choose a theme and create your first Mad Libs template.

| Theme Ideas |
| :---- |
| Adventure story |
| School day |
| Vacation trip |
| Cooking disaster |
| Superhero origin |
| Your own idea: _________________ |

**Word Types Needed:** Plan what types of words your story will need.

| Word Type | Example | How Many? |
| :---- | :---- | :---: |
| Noun | "elephant" | 2-3 |
| Verb | "dancing" | 2-3 |
| Adjective | "sparkly" | 2-3 |
| Place | "cafeteria" | 1-2 |
| Number | "42" | 1 |

**Write Your Template:** Draft your story with blanks. 

**Example Templates to Inspire You:**

**Template 1: The School Day**
```
Today at [place], my [adjective] teacher asked us to [verb] our [plural noun].
I was so [emotion] that I accidentally [past tense verb] my [noun]! 
The whole class [past tense verb] for [number] minutes straight.
```

**Template 2: The Epic Adventure**
```
Deep in the [adjective] jungle, I discovered a [adjective] [noun]. 
It could [verb] faster than [number] [plural noun]! I decided to 
[verb] it all the way to [place], where I became [adjective] and famous.
```

**Template 3: The Cooking Disaster**
```
My recipe for [adjective] [food item] is simple: First, [verb] 
[number] cups of [plural noun]. Then [adverb] mix in a [adjective] 
[noun]. Bake at [number] degrees until it starts to [verb]. 
Chef [celebrity name] would be so [emotion]!
```

**Template 4: The Superhero Origin**
```
I was just a [adjective] student until I was bitten by a radioactive 
[noun]. Now I can [verb] and [verb] at the speed of [number]! 
My superhero name is [adjective] [noun]-person, and I fight crime in [place].
```

**üí° Pro Tips for Creating Templates:**
- Use 5-8 blanks for a good length story
- Mix different word types (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
- Leave the context mysterious so words are surprising
- The funnier/weirder the scenario, the better!
- Don't be afraid to be creative and silly

**‚úèÔ∏è Your Turn:** Write your own template below (or modify one above to make it yours!)

---

## Step 3 - Plan Your Routes

**Server Routes:** Your Express server will need these routes.

| Route Path | Method | What It Does |
| :---- | :---: | :---- |
| `/` | GET | Serves the main form page |
| `/story` | GET | Displays the completed story |
| `/all-stories` | GET | Shows all saved stories (challenge) |
|  |  |  |

**Form Data Flow:**
1. User fills out form with words
2. User submits form
3. Server receives data
4. Server generates story with template literals
5. Server sends back completed story

---

## Step 4 - Setup Your Project

**Prerequisites Checklist:**
- [ ] Node.js installed (run `node --version` to check)
- [ ] npm installed (run `npm --version` to check)
- [ ] VS Code or text editor ready
- [ ] Terminal/command line access
- [ ] Web browser

**Create Your Project:**
1. Create a new folder: `mkdir mad-libs-project`
2. Navigate to it: `cd mad-libs-project`
3. Initialize npm: `npm init -y`
4. Install Express: `npm install express`
5. Install nodemon (dev tool): `npm install --save-dev nodemon`
6. Create files:
   - `server.js` (your main server file)
   - `public/mad-libs-form.html` (your form page)
7. Update `package.json` scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node server.js",
     "dev": "npx nodemon server.js"
   }
   ```

**Test Your Setup:**
- Run `npm run dev` in terminal
- You should see "Server running on port 3000" (after you complete Level 2)

**Milestone:** You should have multiple story templates that users can choose from.

**Phase 3: Challenge Features (Levels 10-14) ‚ö°**
*Optional - for advanced students or extra credit*
- ‚ö° Level 10: Data storage in memory
- ‚ö° Level 11: Display all saved stories
- ‚ö° Level 12: Random story selection
- ‚ö° Level 13: Story deletion feature

---

## Step 6 - Test Your Application

Verify your Mad Libs app works correctly:

| Test | What to Check | ‚úì |
| :---- | :---- | :---: |
| Server starts | No errors, listens on port 3000 |  |
| Form loads | HTML form displays correctly at `/` |  |
| Form submission | Clicking submit shows story page |  |
| Story displays | User's words appear in the story |  |
| Bootstrap styles | Page looks professional and styled |  |
| Multiple stories | Can select different story templates |  |
| Missing inputs | Handles empty form fields gracefully |  |

**Debug Common Issues:**

| Problem | Solution |
| :---- | :---- |
| "Cannot GET /" error | Make sure `express.static('public')` is set up |
| Port 3000 in use | Stop other servers or change port number |
| Words don't show | Check form `name` attributes match `req.query` |
| Styles not working | Verify Bootstrap CDN link in HTML `<head>` |
