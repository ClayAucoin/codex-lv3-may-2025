## üÜò Getting Help

**If you get stuck:**

1. Check the [Detailed Activity Guide](./ASSIGNMENT_WEEK1.md) troubleshooting section
2. Use `console.log()` to debug variables
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Review the level-by-level guides
5. Ask in class or office hours
6. Post questions in the discussion forum

**Common Issues:**
- **Port 3000 in use:** Change to `PORT = 3001`
- **Cannot GET /:** Check `app.use(express.static('public'))`
- **Form data missing:** Verify input `name` attributes match `req.query` usage
- **Styles not loading:** Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
