* TODO: Solve the [Bee puzzles](https://studio.code.org/courses/course1/units/1/lessons/14/levels/1) as a warmup to loops.
* TODO: Start with [Loops Explore](https://studio.code.org/courses/course1/units/1/lessons/14/levels/1) and answer the question. Don't take too long on this!
* TODO: Move on to [Loops Investigate](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2025/units/6/lessons/6/levels/1). There is not much to do, but a lot to observe and investigate.
* TODO: Work on [Loops Practice](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2025/units/6/lessons/7/levels/1) and get some good practice with Loops.
* TODO: Finally, work on [Loops Make](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2025/units/6/lessons/8/levels/1) to create your own app with loops.

Loops are one of the basic building blocks of algorithms. Being able to use loops will unlock a whole new avenue of programming!
